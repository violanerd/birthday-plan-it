## **An app to plan and personalize your birthday party by creating a cool invitation and RSVP list. Let's get the party started!**

<br>

## **Purpose:**

Welcome to the Birthday Plan It app where we help you plan your birthday party by creating a cool invitation. Simply sign up to create an account then pick a theme from the thumbnails below. Once you’ve selected a theme you will fill out the form to create your invitation. Then you’ll create a list of email addresses to send the invite link to. Guests will be able to signup and rsvp to your party. On the My Party page you’ll then be able to see your rsvp list!
